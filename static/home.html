                The Stock Market in the Music Industry has become increasingly popular in the modern day. 
                Not only are audio streaming services such as Spotify or Sirius XM interested in selling stock, 
                but many artists have taken interest in the market as well. 
                Artists have decided to sell the rights to their music for their own price and our team at Beats and Blockchains 
                is determined to make this process nice and simple for our customers!
